## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Showcase

### Core Prompt Engineering Techniques Demonstrated

#### 1. **Multi-Domain Command Classification**
```python
# Intelligent command routing using few-shot learning
def classify_command_prompt(user_input):
    return f"""
    You are an intelligent command classifier for a voice assistant. 
    Analyze the user's natural language input and classify it into categories:

    Categories: EXCEL, EMAIL, SYSTEM, WEB, UTILITY, MEDIA, INFO

    Examples:
    Input: "Send an email to john about the meeting tomorrow"
    Output: EMAIL

    Input: "Create a chart from data in cells A1 to C10"  
    Output: EXCEL

    User Input: {user_input}
    Classification:
    """
```

#### 2. **Context-Aware Email Generation**
```python
# Dynamic email template selection based on context
def email_generation_prompt(recipient, subject, context):
    return f"""
    Generate a professional email based on the context and subject matter.
    
    Context Analysis:
    - Recipient: {recipient}
    - Subject: {subject} 
    - Context: {context}
    
    Template Selection Rules:
    - If subject contains "sick/illness" → Use sick leave template
    - If subject contains "meeting/appointment" → Use meeting template
    - If subject contains "follow/update" → Use follow-up template
    - Otherwise → Use general professional template
    
    Generate appropriate email with proper tone and structure.
    """
```

#### 3. **Excel Operation Orchestration**
```python
# Complex Excel operations through structured prompts
def excel_operation_prompt(command):
    return f"""
    Convert natural language to Excel operations:
    
    Available Operations:
    - CREATE_CHART: Generate visualizations
    - APPLY_FORMULA: Mathematical operations
    - CONDITIONAL_FORMAT: Visual data highlighting
    - CREATE_TABLE: Data structuring
    
    Command: "{command}"
    
    Output JSON format:
    {{
      "operation": "OPERATION_TYPE",
      "parameters": {{"range": "A1:C10", "chart_type": "column"}},
      "steps": ["Step 1: Select data", "Step 2: Insert chart"]
    }}
    """
```

#### 4. **Error Recovery & User Guidance**
```python
# Intelligent error handling with contextual solutions
def error_recovery_prompt(error_type, context):
    return f"""
    Provide empathetic error recovery for voice assistant:
    
    Error: {error_type}
    Context: {context}
    
    Response Structure:
    1. Acknowledge error empathetically
    2. Explain in simple terms
    3. Provide 2-3 alternative solutions
    4. Include prevention tip if applicable
    
    Keep response under 50 words for voice delivery.
    Maintain helpful, professional tone.
    """
```
