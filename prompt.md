## ðŸ§  Advanced Prompt Engineering Examples

The following prompts are the actual implementations used in our AIVA project. These demonstrate sophisticated prompt patterns including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, context injection, and intelligent error recovery.

### 1. Intent Classification Prompts

```python
def classify_complex_intent(self, user_command: str, context: Dict = None) -> Dict:
    """
    Multi-layered intent classification with confidence scoring
    Demonstrates: Few-shot learning, context awareness, confidence estimation
    """
    
    classification_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this voice command for intent classification:
    Command: "{user_command}"
    
    Context: {context or 'No previous context'}
    
    Examples of command patterns:
    
    EMAIL INTENTS:
    - "Send email to john about meeting tomorrow" â†’ INTENT: compose_email, CONFIDENCE: 0.95
    - "Check my inbox for messages from Sarah" â†’ INTENT: check_email, CONFIDENCE: 0.92
    - "Reply to the last email saying I'll be there" â†’ INTENT: reply_email, CONFIDENCE: 0.88
    
    EXCEL INTENTS:
    - "Create a pie chart from column A data" â†’ INTENT: create_chart, CONFIDENCE: 0.94
    - "Sum values in cells B2 to B10" â†’ INTENT: calculate_formula, CONFIDENCE: 0.96
    - "Format cells A1 to C5 as currency" â†’ INTENT: format_cells, CONFIDENCE: 0.93
    
    SYSTEM INTENTS:
    - "What's my CPU usage right now" â†’ INTENT: system_info, CONFIDENCE: 0.91
    - "Close all browser tabs" â†’ INTENT: close_applications, CONFIDENCE: 0.89
    - "Set volume to 50 percent" â†’ INTENT: control_system, CONFIDENCE: 0.95

    MULTI-INTENT EXAMPLES:
    - "Send email to team about delay AND set reminder for follow-up" â†’ 
      PRIMARY: compose_email (0.94), SECONDARY: set_reminder (0.91)
    - "Open Excel, create chart from sales data, then save as Q4 report" â†’ 
      SEQUENCE: [open_excel (0.96), create_chart (0.92), save_file (0.94)]
    
    Classification Rules:
    1. Identify primary intent (highest confidence)
    2. Detect secondary intents if present
    3. Determine if sequential execution needed
    4. Handle ambiguous cases with clarification
    5. Consider voice recognition errors (atâ†’@, dotâ†’.)
    
    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    {{
        "primary_intent": "intent_name",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "secondary_intents": [list],

### 7. Personalization & Learning Prompts

```python
def generate_personalized_response(self, command: str, user_profile: Dict = None) -> Dict:
    """
    Personalized response generation based on user patterns and preferences
    Demonstrates: User modeling, adaptive behavior, preference learning
    """
    
    personalization_prompt = f"""
    Generate personalized response based on user profile and behavior patterns:
    
    Command: "{command}"
    User Profile: {user_profile or {}}
    
    PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
